There is a chance we can't detect them because of bad timing!\n\nIncrease the 'Away delay' to keep the device present for a certain amount of seconds. In some cases the 'Stress mode' may provide additional help. Must be a value between 1 and 3600. \n\nFinetuning is required! If the value is to small, a device may start flipping between 'present' and 'away'. If the value is to large, it will wait too long before triggering your flows."
