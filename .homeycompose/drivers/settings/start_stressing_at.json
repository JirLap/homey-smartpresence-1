'x' seconds before the device will be marked as 'away', it will be checked more often. Must be a value between 0 and 600.\n\nIf you have trouble with a device, it can help you to get more stable results.\n\nNever configure this value higher then the 'Away delay' value, cause then every check will be a stress check! If you configure this setting to 0, then Stress mode will be disabled."
