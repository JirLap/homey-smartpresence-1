Detects the presence of humans by their smartphones. The app works on detecting closed TCP ports of smart phones on your Wifi networks. This means it functions without installing the Homey app, allowing you to detect guests as well.

The app does NOT support MAC-addresses, cause of limitations in Homey.


Adding device:

For adding a device, please follow the following steps:

1. Give guest your wifi password.
2. Check the IP address of the smartphone. Most router user interfaces support this.
3. Make a DHCP reservation for the IP address, this makes sure that the device will get the same address every time. Again: most routers support DHCP reservations in their user interface.
4. Enter the IP address of the smartphone
5. Check 'Is Guest' if the smartphone does belong to a house guest. Don't check it if the smartphone belongs to a household member.
